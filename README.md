## Questions-and-Answers

**[How shall a link to a website be entered in an AAS, as File or as ReferenceElement object?](#id2)** <a id="id2"></a><!-- ID: 2 -->

Links to websites shall be entered as File object (physical reference). ReferenceElement  objects represent logical references.
A typical usage for logical references is in the description of a topology of the asset or „consist of” hierarchies.

**[If the same properties are used in several submodels, shall they also be entered several times or shall they be referenced?](#id5)** <a id="id5"></a><a id="id23"></a><!-- ID: 5, 23 -->

Submodels shall be as independent as possible so that they can be changed and developed separately.
Consequently, the same properties shall be copied to another submodel and references shall not be used in such case. 
The concept description referenced in semanticId, however, should be the same.

(Answered: 2020-08-13)

**[How to use physical units for quantifiable properties?](#id7)** <a id="id7"></a><a id="id20"></a><!-- ID: 7, 20 -->

AAS defines specific constructs of unit and unitID for concept descriptions (template DataSpecificationIEC61360).
We advise you to use unitIDs  that refer to pre-defined eCl@ss IRDIs, e.g., 0173-1#05-AAA480#002  for millimeters. 
In a non-likely case of non-existent global IRDI for a unit, please [follow the general guidance for custom semantic IDs
to create a custom unitID](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/questions-and-answers/blob/master/README.md#id3).

(Answered: 2020-08-13)

**[What shall be entered for the semanticId attribute if a related concept description does not exist in eCl@ss or IEC CDD?](#id3)** <a id="id3"></a><!-- ID: 3 -->

Besides eCl@ss and IEC CCD also other domain specific dictionaries may be used. The only prerequisite is that the id can be uniquely resolved.

This also holds true for proprietary dictionaries. For example, the id of a proprietary concept description defined by your own company could be <CompanyName>/<FurtherHierarchicalName>/<PropertyName>”. This id is also used as semanticId of the property then.

Alternatively, an agile flexible approach using GITHUB has been defined. You may store your CDs there which are defined as “http://admin-shell.io/<sub-namespace>[/<version>[/<revision>]]/<ShortId>”. The working draft repository is placed at https://github.com/admin-shell-io/id.

**[How shall the eCl@ss group “Zusatzdokumentation (e.g. IRDI 0173-1#02-ADN464#..)” be used for documentation?](#id8)** <a id="id8"></a><!-- ID: 8 -->

Please use the submodel template based on VDI 2770 for documentation instead. It will be released soon.

**[How to treat values of Properties with values in multiple languages?](#id9)** <a id="id9"></a><!-- ID: 9 -->

Details of the Asset Administration Shell Part 1 provides the **MultiLanguageProperty** entity for this case since version 2.0.

**[How shall a document be handled which includes different content according to VDI 2770 and the related DocumentClassIDs?](#id10)** <a id="id10"></a><!-- ID: 10 -->

Currently, VDI 2770 only allows exactly one DocumentClassID per document. A proposal has been already made to the VDI 2770 workgroup to extend this. In AAS it is suggested to list several properties with different DocumentClassIDs for such a multipurpose document.

**[Which names are already defined for important submodels?](#id12)** <a id="id12"></a><a id="id21"></a><a id="id24"></a><!-- ID: 12, 21, 24 -->

The following names shall be used for submodels:

- [**Nameplate**](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/Submodel_templates-Asset_Administration_Shell-digital_nameplate.html) defines digital nameplate
- **Identification** defines supplier and product, 
- [**TechnicalData**](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/Submodel_templates-Asset_Administration_Shell-Technical_Data.html) for technical data of a product,
- **ConfigurationData** for setpoints of a production process,
- **OperationalData** for actual values of a production process,
- **Documentation** to store documents for a product and to classify the documentation according to VDI 2770,
- **CertificatesAndDeclaration** for storing certificates and conformance classes.

(Answered: 2020-08-13)

**[How to store certificates and conformance declarations within AAS/Submodels?](#id13)** <a id="id13"></a><!-- ID: 13 -->

A dedicated submodel with IdShort “CertificatesAndDeclarations” with ID https://admin-shell.io/submodels/CertificatesAndDeclarations is proposed. This model shall contain boolean properties or text-properties indicating conformance to certificates. Actual certificate documents, e.g., scanned TÜV reports, shall be contained in the “Documentation” submodel and referenced from “CertificatesAndDeclarations” elements.

Examples are the boolean property **0173-1#02-BAF053#008** set to true if a CE qualification is present, or the text-property **0173-1#02-AAE327#001** for a textual name of the fulfilled conformance.

(Answered: 2020-08-13)

**[Which mechanisms can be used to structure complex data?](#id15)** <a id="id15"></a><!-- ID: 15 -->

Collections can be used to “physically” separate and structure submodel elements into different topics.

Qualifiers can be used to add additional meta-information to AAS elements that is not included in the model of AAS. 
Currently (Details of AAS Part 1 Version 2), concrete qualifiers are not specified, however the document provides some non-normative examples for qualifiers:
e.g. the indication of a lifecycle state of a value by “as-specified” or “as-measured”, or
e.g. the indication of multiplicity of allowed components for modelling by “greater than 0” and others.

**[What are best practices for creating custom IRI identifiers for generic concepts?](#id18)** <a id="id18"></a><!-- ID: 18 -->

What are best practices for creating custom IRI identifiers for generic concepts.
We advise using “https://admin-shell.io/” prefix for those identifiers (see guides via https://github.com/admin-shell-io/id/) for generic concepts. Note that we advise to use “https:” protocol and avoid adding “www.” subdomain into admin-shell.io naming scheme.
Furthermore, in practical implementations we advise to “filter” out protocol and schema for comparing IRI identifiers. For example, following IDs should be considered equal:
-	https://admin-shell.io/some_id_example
-	http://admin-shell.io/some_id_example
-	ftp://admin-shell.io/some_id_example
-	https://www.admin-shell.io/some_id_example
-	http://www.admin-shell.io/some_id_example

**[Which submodel shall contain the serial number of a device?](#id23)** <a id="id23"></a><!-- ID: 23 -->

Serial number is a submodel element of “Identification” submodel referenced in AAS for an asset with Type=Instance, i.e. instance’s AAS. 

(Answered: 2020-08-19)

**[How to refer to semantic concepts of existing standards like VDI 2770 properties or OPC UA companion specifications (e.g. “Serial number” property from OPC UA DI companion spec)?](#id27)** <a id="id27"></a><a id="id28"></a><!-- ID: 27, 28 -->

Map concepts to “admin-shell.io” namespace (see [custom identifier best practices](#id18)). Within the concept description itself use “sourceOfDefinition” or “isCaseOf” to link to “original” concept. 

(Answered: 2020-08-24)

**[Are there any best practices how to choose the idShort of an element?](#id30a)** <a id="id30a"></a><!-- ID: 30a -->

For choosing an idShort value there are the following recommendations (rules and order can be used for automatically creation of an idShort):

- If an English shortname is available in the related concept description, the English shortName can be used as idShort. 
- If there is an English preferredName available in the related concept description, this name can be converted to idShort, e.g. the preferredName “Maximum rotation speed” can be converted to “maximumRotationSpeed”.

In case a submodel template specification is used as a base, the idShort defined in this submodel template shall be used.

Note: the isShort does not carry any semantic meaning. For speaking names the display name shall be used.

(Updated: 2021-05-17)


**[I need a speaking name on my dashboard - which attribute value shall I use?](#id30b)** <a id="id30b"></a><!-- ID: 30b -->

For speaking names (in different languages) the display name (Referable/displayName) shall be used.

If no display name is defined in the language requested by the application, then the display name is selected in the following order if available:
- the preferred name in the requested language of the concept description defining the semantics of the element
- If there is a default language list defined in the application, then the corresponding preferred name in the language is chosen according to this order.
- the English preferred name of the concept description defining the semantics of the element
- the short name of the concept description
- the idShort of the element

Note: DisplayName was introduced with Part 1, V3.0RC01. Display name is optional.

**[Where shall images (products or icons) of an asset be stored, e.g., for the use in dashboards?](#id31)** <a id="id31"></a><!-- ID: 31 -->

With V3.0RC01 of Part 1 an optional attribute "assetInformation/defaultThumbnail" was introduced. The type of this attribute is "File".

The standardized [submodel template "Generic Frame for Technical Data for Industrial Equipment in Manufacturing" (Version 1.1)](https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Submodel_Templates-Asset_Administration_Shell-Technical_Data.html) allows to add as many product images as needed (https://admin-shell.io/ZVEI/TechnicalData/Productimage/1/1). Again, the type of these images is "File".

(Updated: 2021-02-08)

**[How shall properties be entered which are defined both in eCl@ss and in CDD?](#id34)** <a id="id34"></a><!-- ID: 34 -->

If definitions for several product application areas are needed (e.g. eCL@ss for factory automation and CDD for process automation), the related properties (e.g. ManufacturerName) shall be entered twice. At each of the properties one of the concept descriptions (eCl@ss or CDD) is entered. The name of a property shall be either counted up (e.g. ManufactureName1) or extended by a suffix (e.g. ManufacturerNameCDD).

Alternatively an own concept description may be defined and "isCaseOf" may be used, so that both IRDIs can be entered in the concept description.

**[Is the following IRI-based ID with a query parameter valid “http://vendor.com/suffx?a=abc&b=xyz”?](#id38)** <a id="id38"></a><!-- ID: 38 -->

Yes, this is a valid ID.

(Answered: 2020-09-21)


**[Are semanticId(s) optional or mandatory?](#id40)** <a id="id40"></a><!-- ID: 40 -->

Although semanticIds are optional it is recommended to add a semantic reference (semanticId) whenever possible: without semanticId there is no semantic interoperability. IdShort of elements can be standardized as is done for some elements in submodel templates. However, this is not sufficient. Additionally, a semanticId is needed, for example to include version information or information about variants about the same element.

Sometimes there is no standardized concept description available in ECLASS or IEC CDD. See the [answer to this question](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/questions-and-answers#id3) for how to deal with this case. 

In AAS Part 1 V3.0RC01 semanticId(s) are not mandatory for submodels or submodel elements. SemanticId(s) are recommended to be added for submodel instances and submodel elements.

Up to AAS Part 1 V2.0 semanticId(s) were mandatory for submodel elements and were recommended for submodels with kind=Instance. For submodels with kind=Template the semanticId was optional.

(Updated: 2021-02-08)


**[Can semantic ID(s) be used without defining a concept description within the AAS package?](#id41)** <a id="id41"></a><!-- ID: 41 -->

Yes. Please use the following alternatives:
-	type=ConceptDescription, local=True: the concept description is within the package or deployed on the same server like the element referring to it
-	type=ConceptDescription, local=False: the concept description is located within a different pakckage or possibly deployed on a different server than the element referring to it
-	type=GlobalReference, local=False: a concept description object is not defined, just a reference to an external source is made

**[Is it allowed to have both, Submodel Templates and Submodel Instances, in the same AAS?](#id42)** <a name="id42"></a> 

Submodel Templates guide the creation of Submodel Instances. Although the specification does not restrict an Asset Administration Shell to contain both, Submodels with kind=Template and Submodels with kind=Instance, it is good practice to separate Submodel Templates from Submodel Instances. Typically, the owners of and the life cycle for creating and maintaining Submodel Templates are different from the owners of and from creating and operating Submodel Instances. 

(Answered: 2021-01-08)

**[How should I name a submodel element if there are more than one with the same semanticId?](#id43)** <a id="id43"></a>

There are several ways to deal with the topic of naming in the case that there is a set of elements (Referable/idShort), each with the same semanticId (for example in a SubmodelElementCollection with allowDuplicated=True):
* just number the elements (Example: Document01, Document02, Document{nn})
* assign a speaking name to each (Example: WheelFrontLeft, WheelFrontRight, WheelRearLeft, WheelRearRight)
Via display names (introduced in V3.0RC01 Referable/displayName, it is also possible to assign more speaking names in a later stage if needed)

Note: It is requested that the idShort of a non-identifiable is unique in its name space (for example in a Submodel or in a SubmodelElementCollection). This is not requested for the display names!

**[How to treat ECLASS Quantity Concept in AAS?](#id44)** <a id="id44"></a>

Example why quantities are needed additionally to units to automatically check compatibility of two properties: The unit "Newtonmeter" can be linked to the quantity "torque" but also to the quantity "energy". Only if the quantity is the same a conversion of the property value is possible.

The metamodel of the AAS (status: V3.0RC01) does not explicitly support the concept of quantities. This means, in case properties are not defined in ECLASS or in any other standardized dictionary it is not possible to specify the quantity of this proprietary property. In case the property is defined in ECLASS then the quantity is defined implicitly, because it is defined in ECLASS itself.

Future versions of the AAS might support quantities:

* by IRDI reference only in the concept description of a property (i.e. extending data specification DataSpecificationIEC61360)
* by additinally providing a corresponding data specification template for quantities conformant to IEC61360

Please be aware: the AAS does not support the concept of alternative units (as does IEC 61360 or ECLASS): it is assumed that the unit specified is also the unit that is used.

In general: The aim of the basic AAS concept is not about defining semantics, it is about referencing concept descriptions. Support of corresponding data specifciations is optional anyway.

 **[How should array data values within the AAS be represented if array elements have the same semantic ID?](#id45)** <a id="id45"></a>

Short-term solution:
Use "Blob"-element, e.g., "[1,2,3,4,5]" having a "serialized" JSON-value format (see upcoming time series submodel template). The data types of array's content, e.g. string, float or integer, can be defined using custom semantic ID of the submodel element.
(Design decision: take "Blob" instead of String in order not to overload generic UIs with representation of possibly long arrays.)

Mid- to long-term solution:
A change to metamodel of the AAS is required. A work item has been passed to the sub working group.

 **[How to use qualifiers?](#id46)** <a id="id46"></a>

In this Repository, you can find a qualifier example in the folder "Examples". It contains an AAS (Qualifier_Examples.aasx) with a Submodel called "QualifierExampleSubmodel". 
1. In this Submodel the property "MaxRotationSpeed" has two example qualifiers (ExpressionSemantic=ASSURANCE_1 and PredicateRelation=GREATER_THAN_0). They are extracted from [DIN SPEC 92000](https://www.beuth.de/en/technical-rule/din-spec-92000/320981982) and state that the Submodel assures, that the asset's MaxRotationSpeed is greater than 30 1/min.
2. Besides that, the Submodel contains the Submodelelementcollection "Width_LifeCycle", which contains the Property width three times. Based on IEC 62569-1:2017, the property "width" might need different values during the assets life cycle. In the example, there are three slightly different values for "As Specified", "As Built" and "As Decomissioned" (life cycle qual=SPEC, life cycle qual=BUILT, life cycle qual=DECOM). You may find further information about this concept in the [IEC Common Data Dictionary](https://cdd.iec.ch/cdd/iec61360/iec61360.nsf/e0e56d2682a34311c12575560058dc1c/20bf16149b5986a8c12586470047d709)

Further information on qualifiers and the usage in the AASx Package Explorer can be found in the specific [screencast on qualifiers](https://admin-shell-io.com/screencasts/aasx-package-explorer/en/Aasx_PackEx_Tutorial_-_EN_-_16_Working_with_qualifiers.mp4)
